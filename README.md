# Random-password-with-sending-password
In this project, I'm going to create the random password generator and send the message to the user that Random password has generated.
First file is password.py that contains the code to generate the random password.
Second file is sender.py that sends the message to the User.
Third and the last one is again-test.py. This file imports both file.

So, Let's go back to the first file.---> password.py
First of all, I've importted the random module. This module randomly choose the element from the sequence.
Second module is array that I've used to create the Constraint data type.
